Description:
  Short: a set of customizable procedures to iterate through sets of objects
  Long: >
    One recurrent task in Praat is to iterate through a number of objects of
    different types to examine them in detail, make manual editions, etc.

    This plugin provides commands to iterate through sets of objects opening
    an editor to _view each_ object in turn. Hence the name. Thanks to the
    selection management procedures provided by cpran/selection, the
    iteration is unaffected by changes in the selection and even by the
    removal of previously selected objects.

    The commands provided rely on a set of procedures that also expose a large
    number of hooks to make it easier to customize the behaviour of the
    iteration. This effectively gives a proficient programmer complete control
    over what happens at every step of the iteration in a reliable and robust
    way.
